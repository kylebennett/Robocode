# Robocode

Welcome to the Robocode Arena!

## Getting started

First off download and install Robocode - http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Download

Then clone this repo.

You can create your bot using either the editor in robocode or in a java IDE such as eclipse.

Test your bot in the arena against the robocode sample bots.

Put your bot in the relevant folder then push to the online repo.

## Uploading a Bot

- Enter as many bots as you like, the more carnage, the merrier.
 
- Your package name should be your name. Put all your bots in this package.

## Battles

### Head to Head

The classic duel, two bots enter, one bot leaves.

Head to head competitions will be run using roboleague. Each bot will go head to head with all the other entrants, best of three rounds. Winner is the bot with the highest total points score.

### Free for All

*TOTAL MAYHEM*

Every single bot entered is thrown into the arena, winner is the bot with the most points at the end of 5 rounds. 

## General Rules

- Bots need to be psuhed to the relevant folder in this repo, at the deadline I'll take a cut and the bots in the repo will be entered into the competition.

- Bots must be entered before the deadline, otherwise they won't enter the arena.

- No tampering with other peoples bots, I can see what you've done in the git commits... I'll know.

- Don't be *that* guy, yes there are plenty of other bots available online but please don't just copy and paste. This is supposed to be a fun competition and a way to improve our engineering skills, it won't be either of those if you just cut and paste.
